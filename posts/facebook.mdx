I haven't been keeping up with my website over the past few years, but wanted to post a quick update that I'm now working at Facebook. This will be my second job after college - starting something new is pretty scary, but I'm excited to have the chance to learn more about front-end web development and for the growth oppportunities I'll have.

In other news I'm hoping to write an article about [Aquarius](https://github.com/ianmitchell/aquarius) "soon" - we'll see how that goes though!
