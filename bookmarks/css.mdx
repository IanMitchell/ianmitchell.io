_Core_

1. **[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)** - I _rarely_ see a project that isn't using this. Whenever you create a new website, your first step should be including this file.

_Flexbox_

1. **[Flexbox Cheatsheet](http://jonibologna.com/flexbox-cheatsheet/)** - I use this cheatsheet the time. Very helpful explanation on what the different Flexbox properties do.
2. **[Solved by Flexbox](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/)** - Flexbox is amazing. If you're having trouble learning it, this is a great guide for common layouts.
3. **[Flexbox Reading List](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/the-flexbox-reading-list/)** - Learn Flexbox, it is absolutely worth it. I promise.

_Tricks for Polish_

1. **[Modal Overlay with CSS](https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog/status/251474657490903040)** - Instead of a complicated HTML / CSS hybrid, Lea Verou shows how to get an overlay with one line of CSS. Apologies for not having the original tweet.
2. **[Easy Visual Separator](http://codepen.io/mor10/pen/pgMLXY/)** - My favorite way of styling a partial underline / border.
3. **[Font Smoothing](https://davidwalsh.name/font-smoothing)** - I'm not sure if this is needed anymore, but for a time it was a lifesaver.
4. **[Font Features](https://webkit.org/blog/5735/css-font-features/)** - Neat CSS tricks to get the most out of web typography.
5. **[Correct Rounded Corners](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-rounded-corners-done-right--webdesign-7127)** - A quick explanation on correctly rounding corners with borders.

_Responsive Media and Layouts_

3. **[CSS Tetris](http://www.heydonworks.com/article/tetris-the-power-of-css)** - Some tricks on how to leverage CSS to prevent orphan grid items.
4. **[Object Fit](http://thenewcode.com/967/The-Widescreen-Web-Using-CSS-object-fit)** - This is something I need to learn more about. I think it has huge potential to ease responsive designs.

6. **[Full Screen Images](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/)** - Additional information on large image trends in web development. This article is older; focus on the `background-size: cover` bit. You shouldn't need prefixes / IE hacks anymore. **NOTE:** I learned this the hard way when working on [Company Inc.](http://companyinc.company), but mobile browsers don't support full screen background images very well (or at all) due to the massive performance hit.

_Colors and Fonts_
